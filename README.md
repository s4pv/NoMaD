# LiveAndTravel

# META Problem:
Create an RPG Game/Dapp (Solidity) on an Ethereum fork with an economy/ecosystem that solves:

Metaverse Inmersion.

Web3.

Real life goals instead of consumer behavior oriented.

Community building.

Efficient Consensus Mechanism based on actual blockchain capabilities and game needs.


# 1st Approach: P2E Game (not pay to earn): LiveToTravel – CryptoZombies “fork”

Consensus Mechanism: Proof of Work. If you stay on a fixed real place (Workplace) for several hours, your avatar will start to WORK, mining LIVE tokens. (Through glasses, smartwatch, notebook, and phone if possible, available and permissioned)

When you TRAVEL, you will earn TRAVEL tokens. Additional proofs may be needed and posted public or private. (photos, videos, delta-time, non-VPN GPS validation, QR scans, etc)

You can also mint pure AVATARS, or on the market you can trade AVATARS (NFT), PIECES (NFT) for LIVE & TRAVEL tokens respectively.

You can BREED (mint) AVATARS (2 AVATARS -> a new AVATAR with mixed DNA) and MERGE (mint) PIECES (2 PIECES -> new PIECE with mixed characteristics) using LIVE & TRAVEL tokens which will be burnt.

TRAVEL Tokens are inflationary and LIVE tokens are deflationary.

Through an achievement points system, leveling, stats and race, the AVATAR have special real-life abilities and different quests access. Similar applies for PIECES.

AVATAR and PIECE abilities will grant a real-life connection ecosystem while at the same time incentivizing real traveling: traveling discounts, hotel rooms discounts, breakfasts, etc.

There will be QRs/NPCs on public plazas, airports, and public attractions near great cities all around the world, where you can start/end proof of TRAVEL quests and buy/sell travel stuff with ingame tokens.
